# Frontend Web Project for Java EE

Welcome to the frontend web project for the Java EE course!

This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It uses several popular libraries including:

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): provides pre-built components that make it easy to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): allows users to navigate between different pages of the application without the need for a full page refresh.
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): offers a vast collection of icons that can be easily integrated into the application.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to a backend server.

To get started with the project, you can run the following commands:

- `npm install` to install the required dependencies
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to create a production build of the application
